 - list of public chat links etc,
 - list of visible pset groups
 - list of course members
 - group control panel: look for match, create visible group, etc
 - link to course preference for matching

* Pset group homepage (different view depending on whether you're a member or not)
 - name the group (autogenerated initial suggestion)
 - list members with contact info
 - ability to remove yourself

Match flow
===== ====

* When course is created, someone has to enter pset deadlines
* Students fill out initial preferences
* Students can create open groups, and anyone can join open groups
* 2-3 days into the course, generate initial unlisted groups from students who have requested a match
* After each pset, email students who were put into a new unlisted group by the system (in the most recent round) to check if they are happy.
* If you ever withdraw from a group, the system will never match you with them again
