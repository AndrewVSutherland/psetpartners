Setup/Config
============

* Add a link in canvas?
* For the fall we populated the class database manually, but this needs to change in the spring

Decisions
=========

* Should public group membership be public or optionally public (currently you have to join to see who is a member, which sends an email to everyone else).  One option would be to make the identity of the creator of the group public.
* Who should be able to edit group preferences?  Currently only creator can edit groups they created, but all members can edit groups created by the system.

Pages needed
=============

* Course homepage
 - basic course info
 - link to actual course homepage
 - list of public chat links etc,
 - list of public pset groups (already available on student pages)
 - list of course members
 - match dates (presumably organized around pset deadlines)
* Instructor homepage (basically a list of course homepages)

Matching restriction
====================

* If you ever withdraw from a group, the system should never match you with that group again.
* Blocklist (prevent matching with any group containing a blocked list of kerbs)
