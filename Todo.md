Setup/Config
============

* Add a link in canvas?
* For the fall we populated the class database manually, but this needs to change in the spring

Decisions
=========

* Should public group membership be visible? (currently you have to join to see the list of members, which sends an email to everyone else).  One option would be to make the identity of the creator of the group public.
* Who should be able to edit group preferences?  Currently only creator can edit groups they created, but all members can edit groups created by the system.
* For private groups, who can send invitations for membership?/

Pages needed
=============

* Course homepage, including an editable list of public resources (e.g. chat links), public pset groups (already available on student pages), and course members, as well as matching dates (presumably organized around pset deadlines)
* Instructor homepage (basically a list of course homepages, but instructors can see all groups, not just public groups)

Matching restriction
====================

* If you ever withdraw from a group, the system should never match you with that group again (this might be too extreme, maybe make it an option?).
* Blocklist (prevent matching with any group containing a blocked list of kerbs)
