  <h2>Welcome to pset partners!</h2>

<p>
  The purpose of this site is to make it easier for MIT students to find classmates to work with on problem sets.  Collaboration is an integral part of the MIT experience, but finding people to work with can be a challenge, especially when so many of us cannot be on campus right now.
</p>

<p>
  To find partners students start by indicating the times there are available for collaboration, the classes they are taking, and any preferences they have, such as their preferred group size or when they like to start working on problem sets.  A student may then
<ul class="about">
    <li><b>join</b> an existing group that is open to new mambers and compatible with their schedule and preferences;</li>
    <li><b>create</b> a new group and list it publicly or send invitations to other students;</li>
    <li><b>enter</b> the pool of students to be matched by the system on the next match date.</li>
</ul>
Each week the system attempts to match the students in the match pool for each class by placing them into groups that are compatible with their schedule and preferences; students in the pool may also be added to existing groups when appropriate.
